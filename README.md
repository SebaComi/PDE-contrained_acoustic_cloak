 The main is called Cloak_soft.m, by changing the main data at the beginning of the code it is possible to run the different cases discussed in the related article.
 Further, the code called "Dati_cloak" contains other parameters that must be set for running the different case studies.
 The code is mainly derived from redbKit library and makes use of tensor_toolbox, both are included in this repository.
